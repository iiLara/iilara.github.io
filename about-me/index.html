    <h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
    <br><br>
    I have a unending passion for Programming and Game Design. I spend as much of my free time as possible making games and experimenting with new tools I've never used before in order to push myself places I've never been before. <br>
    The thrill of the challenge and the feeling of accomplishment make me strive to achieve more and more.<br>
    In my time programming, I have learned and am knowledgeable of <b>C, C#, C++, Java, JS, Lua, Python, HTML, PHP</b> and more. Having this skillset has helped me do what I want to do with technology and understand how to approach different problems or tasks that I may be faced with.<br>
    Some of my proudest projects can be found <a href="../projects/">here</a>, some of them are interactible using WebGL. There are many other projects I have worked on, but refining them down, these are the ones I find the best.
