    I have a unending passion for Programming and Game Design. I spend as much of my free time as possible making games and experimenting with new tools I've never used before in order to push myself places I've never been before. <br>
    The thrill of the challenge and the feeling of accomplishment make me strive to achieve more and more.<br>
    In my time programming, I have learned and am knowledgeable of <b>C, C#, C++, Java, JS, Lua, Python, HTML, PHP</b> and more. Having this skillset has helped me do what I want to do with technology and understand how to approach different problems or tasks that I may be faced with.

  Innovation in my knowledge is something I always strive to achieve, and I feel that computers are similar in that regard. Year by year computers increase in complexity and capability. Growing up surrounded by computers and consoles, I became very intrigued by their inner workings and how they are made to function. I also ended up spending much of my time playing games on said consoles. But I started thinking to myself, what makes games good? Being fairly talented at drawing and art, I took to drawing different environments and ideas I had for numerous games and continue to do so till this day. Designing games is a huge hobby and strong passion of mine.
In Year 11, our school began a robotics group of which I took immediate interest in. The role I landed was as the robot programmer, which is exactly what I was hoping for. During my time as part of the robotics team, I developed great teamwork skills as we all had to work really closely in order to get stuff done as efficiently and as well as possible. All of the effort was to compete in the FTC (First Tech Challenge) competition, and our team went on to win the regionals. We would have gone on to London to compete in the national competition, if COVID did not stop those plans. However, we didn’t let our spirits destroy us and as soon as we could, began planning for the next season. This time, we took what we learned from last season, and took off. We thrived so much we ended up winning the entire competition! FTC awarded us with the Inspire award, the most prestigious award available. Additionally, during lockdown, one of our teachers found themselves in isolation. As a group, we missed them and would’ve liked to have them with us to help with development. And so I decided to make a Java-Python client server system to allow our teacher to control the robot remotely from home. The programming skills I learned from this competition were incredible, as Java is used on an Android based system, and gave me a really solid hand on the Objective-C syntax. This knowledge has allowed me to push myself further and attempt a wide range of new projects that I would have struggled with otherwise.
In my free time, I like to do a lot of programming and develop skills in new areas to constantly push myself. My first large scale project was to create a 3D Engine in the children’s programming tool called Scratch (Of which has no 3D support). In this project, I developed considerable skill in the mathematics and logic behind it, learning complex mathematical concepts such matrices, rotation, vectors and more, and using them myself. The end product of this project was a fully functional 3D engine that ran on the bare bones framework Scratch provides. The challenge of working in a restricted and oversimplified environment improved my problem solving skills immensely and made me think of new ways to work around issues.
Another project of mine was a homebrew project for the Nintendo 3DS, which was essentially a Minecraft clone. Since the code written for the machines is external it has to be written in low-level C. Granted, there are options for writing in JavaScript or Lua; more simple languages, but I’d rather have the challenge of pushing myself to new places. JS and Lua implement automatic memory management and type variable handling, but in order to give myself a more solid understanding of low level operations a computer performs, I used this opportunity to challenge myself and improve my knowledge of complex operations. The resulting game was a fully functional voxel sandbox game with procedural world generation that combined different types of noise to make mountains, hills, caves and more.
My current project for my Computer Science A-Level course is a space exploration survival game where planets are procedurally generated. I have found this to be quite a challenge and have been using available resources to learn new techniques to approach new problems.
