      <!-- This game was made for the first Brackeys 2021 Game Jam in just under a week. During this time I learned a lot about procedural generation and more primitive geometric processes such as mesh generation and UV texturing. The influence was a combination of the style of Minecraft, with a top-down orthographic world management sim idea. Due to the time constraints the project was left incomplete however I feel the product nonetheless was a great demo and learning experience as it taught me a lot in such a short amount of time.

    This game was made for the first Brackeys 2021 Game Jam in just under a week. I wanted to undertake procedural terrain and mesh generation as I was inspired by other people's projects of which were inspired by Minecraft. Up until this point my exposure to actually making terrain and mesh generation was extremely limited and thought it'd be a fun project to undertake.
    <br>
    The general loose "aim" of the game is to recruit more people by bridging across to them and building a town. Like an RTS mixed with Minecraft.
    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout the project I learned many things, I found a lot of enjoyment from learning about Perlin noise functions and using them to make a generation system to produce floating islands. The islands are generated by having a ground noise function that is subtracted from an underground noise function to produce island-like structures.

    I also learned how mesh generation works, producing lists and arrays of vertices and triangles procedurally to make chunks.
    <br>
    If i could improve and make changes to the game today, I'd implement multithreading for the mesh generation in order to make the chunk generation not lag the game so much.
