        This game was made in 48 hours for the GMTK 2020 game jam. A lot of the visuals and minor aspects were rushed in order to produce a functional 2D platformer.

        The game consists of 4 levels (Including the tutorial), but as this was for a game jam, some of the levels may come off as confusing or difficult. As this was made a while ago now, I feel that a better understanding of level design would have helped me at the time of making this game.

        Overall I feel that the game was a success, however improvements can definitely be made in many different areas which holds it back from being my favourite project.
